?action=show_account
&ticket_id=[ID]

Shows end-user info about their account, including their Steam key and
off-Steam download links.

server.php
?action=get_sequence_number
&email=[email address]

Return:

email is unknown to server, 0 will be returned so that initial grant can be
submitted.

server.php
?action=grant
&email=[email address]
&sequence_number=[int]
&hash_value=[hash value]

Return:
assigned_steam_key

DENIED

Used by game servers to indicate that a given email has been granted access to
Another Planet.  An assigned steam key is returned, along with a URL
that the end-user can use to view their account details.

Note that the assigned steam key can be a blank line if we run out of keys

DENIED is returned if there are no life tokens left.


hash_value is computed on both ends with:

  HMAC_SHA1( $shared_secret, $sequence_number$email )

  (sequence number concatonated with email)

Where $shared_secret is a secret string known to both the ahapGate server and
the game servers that have permission to manipulate the ahapGate.

If sequence number is <= previously used sequence number for this email address,
request will be rejected.

Secure against replay attacks and modification of submitted email.
